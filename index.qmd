## Running examples

Most of the data formats covered in this guide have a Jupyter Notebook example that covers the basics of how to read and write the given format. At the top of each notebook is a link to an `environment.yml` file that describes what libraries need to be installed for the notebook to run correctly. You can use [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (a successor to Conda with faster package installs) to install the environment needed to run the notebook.
